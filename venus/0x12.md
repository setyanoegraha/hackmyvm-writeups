# 0x12

This write-up walks through how mission 0x12 was completed, moving from user `lucy` to `elena` and secured `elena`'s flag.

---

As always, first thing first:

```bash
lucy@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x12 #
################

## EN ##
The password of the user elena is between the characters fu and ck 

## ES ##
El password de la usuaria elena esta entre los caracteres fu y ck
```

In the home directory there is a file `file.yo`. We need to find a line that start with `fu` and end with `ck` in that file.

We could use the `grep` command in order the get the line and the combination of reguler expression of `^`, `$`, and `.*`.

```bash
lucy@venus:~$ grep -ra "^fu.*ck$" file.yo
fu[REDACTED]ck
```

verify it:

```bash
lucy@venus:~$ su - elena
Password: 
elena@venus:~$ whoami ; id
elena
uid=1013(elena) gid=1013(elena) groups=1013(elena)
```

Get the flag:

```bash
elena@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
[REDACTED]
```

Objective secured.
