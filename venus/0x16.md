# 0x16

This write-up walks through how mission 0x16 was completed, moving from user `natalia` to `eva`and secured `eva`'s flag.

---
 
As always:

```bash
natalia@venus:~$ cat mission.txt         
################
# MISSION 0x16 #
################

## EN ##
The password of user eva is encoded in the base64.txt file

## ES ##
El password de eva esta encodeado en el fichero base64.txt
```

In the home directory there is a file that was mentioned about.

You can solve this by using `base64` command and using `-d` option as decode.

```bash
natalia@venus:~$ cat base64.txt | base64 -d
[REDACTED] 
```

Verify it:

```bash
natalia@venus:~$ su - eva
Password: 
eva@venus:~$ whoami ; id
eva
uid=1017(eva) gid=1017(eva) groups=1017(eva)
```

Voila! Already logged in as `eva`, now, go get the flag.
