# 0x03

This write-up walks through how mission 0x03 was completed, moving from user `angela` to `emma`.

---

As usual, read the objective:

```bash
angela@venus:~$ cat mission.txt
################
# MISSION 0x03 #
################

## EN ##
The password of the user emma is in line 4069 of the file findme.txt

## ES ##
La password de la usuaria emma esta en la linea 4069 del fichero findme.txt
```

In the home directory there is a file named `findme.txt` and the password for user `emma` is in line 4069. To find exactly line 4069 use `sed` command.

```bash
angela@venus:~$ sed -n "4069p" findme.txt
[REDACTED]
```

The `sed` command prints a specific line from a file. `-n` suppresses other output, and `"4069"` tells `sed` to print line 4069 only.

After retrieving the password, switch to `emma` user:

```bash
angela@venus:~$ su - emma
Password:
emma@venus:~$ whoami;id
emma
uid=1004(emma) gid=1004(emma) groups=1004(emma)
```

That confirms the privelege escalation was successful. Print out the flag:

```bash
emma@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt
[REDACTED]
```
