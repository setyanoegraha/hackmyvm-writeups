# 0x08

This write-up walks through how mission 0x08 was completed, moving from user `eleanor` to `victoria` and secured `victoria`'s flag.

---

As always, read the objective first:

```bash
eleanor@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x08 #
################

## EN ##
The user victoria has left her password in a file in which the owner is the user violin. 

## ES ##
La usuaria victoria ha dejado su password en un fichero en el cual el propietario es el usuario violin.
```

From the desription victoria's password is in a file owned by violin.

Locate that file using `find` command:

```bash
eleanor@venus:~$ find / -type f -user violin 2>/dev/null
/usr/local/games/yo
```

Basically, we are specified the thing we searching for like it's type a file (`-type f`) and it's owner (`-user violin`) from root (`/`) directory as well as suppressing all error output messages (`2>/dev/null`).

Read that file:

```bash
eleanor@venus:~$ cat /usr/local/games/yo
[REDACTED]
```

verify it by switching to `victoria` user:

```bash
eleanor@venus:~$ su - victoria
Password: 
victoria@venus:~$ whoami ; id
victoria
uid=1009(victoria) gid=1009(victoria) groups=1009(victoria)
```

Succesfully logged in as `victoria`, get the flag:

```bash
victoria@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
[REDACTED]
```

Objective Secured.
