# 0x09

This write-up walks through how mission 0x09 was completed, moving from user `victoria` to `isla` and secured `isla`'s flag.

---

As usual, read the objective:

```bash
victoria@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x09 #
################

## EN ##        
The user isla has left her password in a zip file.      

## ES ##
La usuaria isla ha dejado su password en un fichero zip.
```

In the home directory there is a zip file like what the hint said about. However, because we don't have permission to create something in the home directory, we can't extract the file.

Then, we create a temporary directory under `/tmp` and copy that file into it:

```bash
victoria@venus:~$ mkdir /tmp/18512
victoria@venus:~$ cp ./passw0rd.zip /tmp/18512
```

Move to `/tmp/18512` and extract the zip file here:

```bash 
victoria@venus:~$ cd /tmp/18512
victoria@venus:/tmp/18512$ unzip passw0rd.zip 
Archive:  passw0rd.zip
 extracting: pwned/victoria/passw0rd.txt  
 ```

Print the password:

```bash
victoria@venus:/tmp/18512$ cat /pwned/victoria/passw0rd.txt 
[REDACTED]
```

Verify it by switching to user `isla`:

```bash
victoria@venus:/tmp/18512/pwned/victoria$ su - isla
Password: 
isla@venus:~$ whoami ; id
isla
uid=1010(isla) gid=1010(isla) groups=1010(isla)
```

Read the flag:

```bash
isla@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
[REDACTED]
```

Objective Secured.
