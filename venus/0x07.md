# 0x07

This write-up walks through how mission 0x07 was completed, moving from user `luna` to `eleanor`.

---

As usual, read the objective first:

```bash
luna@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x07 #
################

## EN ##
The user eleanor has left her password in a file that occupies 6969 bytes.  

## ES ##
La usuaria eleanor ha dejado su password en un fichero que ocupa 6969 bytes.
```

From the mission, the name of the file isn't specified explicitly but the size of the file is. 

So, locate the file using `find` command:

```bash
luna@venus:~$ find / -type f -size 6969c 2>/dev/null
/usr/share/moon.txt
```

Searching from root directory and specified the size file as well as suppressing the standard error. Read that file:

```bash
luna@venus:~$ cat /usr/share/moon.txt 
[REDACTED]
```

switch to user `eleanor` to verify it:

```bash
eleanor@venus:~$ whoami ; id
eleanor
uid=1008(eleanor) gid=1008(eleanor) groups=1008(eleanor)
```

Go get the flag:
```bash
eleanor@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
[REDACTED]
```

Objective secured.
