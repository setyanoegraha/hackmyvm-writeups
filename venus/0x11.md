# 0x11

This write-up walks through how mission 0x11 was completed, moving from user `violet` to `lucy` and secured `lucy`'s flag.

---

As usual, read the objective:

```bash
violet@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x11 #
################

## EN ##
The password of the user lucy is in the line that ends with 0JuAZ (these last 5 characters are not part of her password)

## ES ##
El password de la usuaria lucy se encuentra en la linea que acaba por 0JuAZ (sin ser estos ultimos 5 caracteres parte de su password)
```

From the mission the password is in line that ends with `0JuAZ` but these characters aren't include.

We can retrieve it using `grep` command and use regular expression with the dollar sign `$` anchor.

```bash
violet@venus:~$ grep "0JuAZ$" end
[REDACTED]0JuAZ
```

After, verify it by switching user to `lucy`:

```bash
violet@venus:~$ su - lucy
Password:
lucy@venus:~$ whoami ; id
lucy
uid=1012(lucy) gid=1012(lucy) groups=1012(lucy)
```

Go get the flag:

```bash
lucy@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
[REDACTED]
```

Objective secured.
