# 0x17

This write-up walks through how mission 0x17 was completed, moving from user `eva` to `clara` and secured `clara`'s flag.

---

As usual:
```bash
eva@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x17 #
################

## EN ##
The password of the clara user is found in a file modified on May 1, 1968. 

## ES ##
La password de la usuaria clara se encuentra en un fichero modificado el 01 de Mayo de 1968.
```

Solved this using:

```bash
eva@venus:~$ find / -mtime +20075 -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs cat
[REDACTED]
```

The puzzle: a file "modified" on `1968-05-01` contains `clara`'s password. But Unix epoch starts at `1970-01-01`, so files can't normally have timestamps earlier than 1970. The trick is to search for files with a very large `-mtime` (i.e., files modified many days ago), which approximates “pre-1970” times.

I estimated the number of days between 1970 and the challenge year (in my case I used 2025):

```bash
2025 - 1970 = 55 years
55 * 365 = 20075 days  (rough approximation, leap years ignored for simplicity)
```

And `xargs` takes each filename from the input and passes it as an argument to `cat`.

verify it:
```bash
eva@venus:~$ su - clara
Password:
clara@venus:~$ whoami;id
clara
uid=1018(clara) gid=1018(clara) groups=1018(clara)
```

Now, go secure the flag in the home directory.
