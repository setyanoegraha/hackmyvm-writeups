# 0x20

This write-up walks through how mission 0x20 was completed, moving from user `eliza` to `iris` and secured `iris`'s flag.

Read the objective first:
```bash
eliza@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################

We could easily logging in as `iris` using `ssh` with `-i` option and then typed `yes`:

```bash
eliza@venus:~$ ssh -i .iris_key iris@localhost

Verify it:
```
iris@venus:~$ whoami ; id 
iris
uid=1021(iris) gid=1021(iris) groups=1021(iris)
```

Now, secure the flag in the home directory.
