# 0x10

This write-up walks through how mission 0x10 was completed, moving from user `isla` to `violet` and secured `violet`'s flag.

---

As always, read the mission first:

```bash
isla@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x10 #
################

## EN ##
The password of the user violet is in the line that begins with a9HFX (these 5 characters are not part of her password.).

## ES ##
El password de la usuaria violet esta en la linea que empieza por a9HFX (sin ser estos 5 caracteres parte de su password.).
```

In the home directory, there is a file named `passy`, when we look into it:

```bash
isla@venus:~$ cat passy 
gRfsUwzARHdRSUOrXbvc
vTLXwbzOnYzjPRRzshdN
lZUtoGkBCVcfSzRpbAFA

NyJUCiEupUYOOMyIprOf
```

There are so many lines inside, it's not efficient to look at it line after line. 

The hint mentioned the password is in the line that begins with `a9HFX` but these 5 characters are not part of the password.

Use `grep` command to get the line:

```bash
isla@venus:~$ grep "^a9HFX" passy 
a9HFX[REDACTED]
```
Verify it by switch to user `violet`:

```bash
isla@venus:~$ su - violet
Password: 
violet@venus:~$ whoami ; id
violet
uid=1011(violet) gid=1011(violet) groups=1011(violet)
```

Succesfully logged in. Now, print out the flag:

```bash
violet@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
[REDACTED]
```

Objective secured.
